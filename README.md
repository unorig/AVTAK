# A View to a Kill (Commodore64) source code
This is the decompiled source code for A View to a Kill for the Commodore 64. 

## Description
I am very slowly working my way through the Commodore 64 code for A View to a Kill for the Commodore 64. I am hoping to better understand the code and one day possibly fix some of the bugs.

## The code

The dis65 files are from 6502 Bench (https://6502bench.com/) which I highly recommend if you are doing any 6502 disassembly.<br>
The S files are the Assembly output from 6502 Bench which will assemble using 64Tass (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/).

## Helpful game codes

If you wanted to play any of the levels the codes are:
- **Opening:** code not required
- **Paris chase:** code not required
- **City Hall:** CCPHJ
- **Mine:** DB4CT
- **Final:** ILVCT

The code for the detonator at the mine level is 67134
